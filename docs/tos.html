        <h1>Terms of Service of Emotes Showcase</h1>
        <p>These are the Terms of Service for the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ext/3yumzvi6r4wfycsk7vt1kbtto9s0n3" title="Extension Listing on Twitch">Emotes Showcase</a> Twitch
        Extension.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>By enabling this extension on your channel, you agree that your sub emote art is displayed in the emote panel. You can choose to hide groups of emotes. The extension does not re-host the emotes on its own services.</li>
            <li>Futher, you guarantee the rights to display all the emote art within this extension. If there are emotes displayed that the channel owner does not have the rights to display, the section must be hidden by the channel owner.</li>
            <li>Support is on an as-possible basis, there are no guaranteed issue resolution timeframes that I can offer.</li>
            <li>This extension relies on various third parties to provide the emote information for a channel. Those third parties may change or cease their offering at any time, leading to the extension no longer finding or displaying emotes.</li>
            <li>The extension is primarily hosted on infrastructure provided by Twitch. Service of that infrastructure is out of the extension author's hands.</li>
            <li>Some of the data is cached by a service provided by the extension author. Operations of that service are on a best-effort basis as long as the extension is officially available for Twitch.</li>
            <li>Older versions of the extension may not work properly. The extension should be auto updated as long as it is normally installed through the provided methods on Twitch.</li>
            <li>The emotes art displayed within this extension are not owned by the author of the extension. The rights to those emotes lie with their respective owners.</li>
            <li>The channel owner must own the rights to the description of emotes, sub tier names and any other freely customizable texts or have permission to reproduce the text from a third party within the extension.</li>
            <li>The default texts provided with the extension are not licenseable due to their shortness, and thus free to use for any channel installing the extension.</li>
        </ul>
