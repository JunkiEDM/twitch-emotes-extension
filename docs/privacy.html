        <h1>Privacy Policy for Emotes Showcase</h1>
        <p>This is the privacy policy for the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ext/3yumzvi6r4wfycsk7vt1kbtto9s0n3" title="Extension Listing on Twitch">Emotes Showcase</a> Twitch
        Extension. Note that loading this policy already contacted the web server
        this policy is concerned about. Sadly there is no way for me to provide the
        policy directly within the extension, so you only have to accept Twitch's
        policy.</p>

        <p>This policy primarily concerns the API provided under "te.humanoids.be",
        which the extension uses to find the emote sets related to a channel's
        subscription tiers. If a channel can not have subscribers, this API is never
        called.</p>

        <p>The server-side of this extension never queries the subscription status
        of any viewer. Deciding if a viewer is subscribed and showing appropriate
        actions based on the result is processed entirely on the viewer's device.</p>

        <p>The extension makes a number of other calls, including to Twitch's own
        API, the API for frankerfacez.com and betterttv.net. Their terms and
        policies apply for those calls. The extension panel does not make these
        calls when the sections were hidden completely in the broadcaster configuration,
        however they will still be performed whenever the broadcaster configuration
        is loaded.</p>

        <p>All requests to this server are logged by the hosting provider to
        prevent attacks and provide anonymous usage statistics.</p>
