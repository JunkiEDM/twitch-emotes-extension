        <h1>Privacy Policy for Emotes Showcase</h1>
        <p>This is the privacy policy for the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ext/3yumzvi6r4wfycsk7vt1kbtto9s0n3" title="Extension Listing on Twitch">Emotes Showcase</a> Twitch
        Extension. Note that loading this policy already contacted a third party server.
        Sadly there is no way for me to provide the policy directly within the extension, to avoid this.</p>

        <p>This extension never queries the subscription status of any viewer on the server side (or some remote system).
        Deciding if a viewer is subscribed and showing appropriate actions based on the result is processed entirely on the viewer's device.
        This also applies to the viewer's follow status, which is only cached while the extension is loaded when Twitch reports it back
        from the follow action.</p>
        
        <p>The extension loads all data directly from the API of the parties providing the servies.
        For Twitch emotes (subscriber, follower, bit tier reward and cheermotes) this means the data
        is acquired from the Twitch API in your browser. Since you already are on the Twitch platform
        at this point, you are presumably already aware of Twitch's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/privacy-notice/">Privacy Notice</a>
        (if not, you should go and look at it, since it is relevant to the extension).</p>

        <p>Other requests made by the extension may include requests to the API for frankerfacez.com and betterttv.net.
        Their terms and policies apply for those calls. The extension panel does not make these
        calls when the sections were hidden completely in the broadcaster configuration,
        however they will still be performed from within the broadcaster configuration.</p>

        <p>All requests to the server hosting this file may be logged by the hosting provider to
        prevent attacks and provide anonymous usage statistics (or possibly other purposes).</p>
